            <p>Hello there! I'm Abhiroop Singh, an enthusiastic Frontend Developer currently enrolled at Georgian College. With a sharp attention 
                to detail and a passion for creating elegant and user-friendly interfaces, I enjoy transforming ideas into reality through coding.

                and excel in solving intricate problems. Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in web development, contributing to

                keeping pace with the dynamic tech landscape.
